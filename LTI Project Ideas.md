# LTI Project ideas

Project ideas:

Make a site that tracks a user's progress on something toward a goal.

Make a site that updates over time, perhaps in relation to something else. Unlike the previous one, it would be less interactive and more informative.

Work with Luke in a collaboration project.
Pros: We can learn from each other and work on different things. Symbiotic properties. I've already learned that he is competent in group projects.
Cons: We'll have trouble making presentations different from each other, and the one that presents to our teachers first has a distinct advantage.

We could create an item used for time management. When a button is pressed, it would send a message containing a timestamp to everyone nearby.

We would create an item and system to record the amount of times an exit and entrance is taken, and display that information on a site.
