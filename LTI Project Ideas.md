# LTI Project ideas

Project ideas:

Make a site that tracks a user's progress on something toward a goal. An example of that would be recording a karate student's belt rank and skills learned.
Further explanation:
A checklist of knowledge/skills a user has acquired and ones to be learned. The user would be ranked on their current ability by the aforementioned belt system.

Make a site that updates over time, perhaps in relation to something else. Unlike the previous one, it would be less interactive and more informative. An example of that might be a counter that tracks something's number, or some kind of image rehosting.


Project ideas with Luke have been omitted due to the current impossibility of his participation.
