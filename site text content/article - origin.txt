Student workers got their start in the IT department after a survey to students concering the mobile app. After that, meetings were attended with student associations and groups by staff. To them, an offer was extended for a student worker position. A student took the opportunity, and acted as a volunteer for some time. Eventually, the student worker became the one who reached out to more students and shared word of the opportunities. Two more students pioneered the new idea of getting class credit for their work with the IT department. Staff were actively involved with helping the student workers.
