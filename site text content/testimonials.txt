Working with students is one of the most fun and rewarding things we do. When we put students to work, it isnÅft just to get them to do some extra work done. We get to mentor our students through the learning process and throughout their projects. Personally, my favorite part is when students start to get comfortable with their project and start making their own contributions. IÅfve seen some excellent work in the past from our students. One student group came in with little app development experience and ended up contributing a whole new section of the app that displays students schedules. Another student came in with some game development experience, and we threw them in the deep end with web and app development. Now we have the website youÅfre reading this on, thanks to this student. Ultimately, being a student worker is rewarding for everyone involved!
