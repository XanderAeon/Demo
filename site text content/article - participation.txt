 It is hoped that in the fall 2018 quarter, a larger student team will be able to be assembled, with all of the required skills for autonomy. This group is hoped to be able to be almost fully independant, without much supervision from staff. In the future, the plan is to continue scaling the student workers up until there are multiple student groups.

Student Roles

    •Developer

    •UI Designer

    •QA Manager

    •Communications Manager

Course credit

Students hoping to earn course credit as a student worker will be glad to learn that this is a tested option. Some of the previous student workers have done this, and we believe that it was a good choice and worked out well for them.
