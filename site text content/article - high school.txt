Offers are also extended to high school students.
Their position would be as a learning intern, who would take training for some time, while learning about the work environment, and doing some work on the way. Their final goal would be to create a project that represents the work they've done and what they've learned.

Being a high school intern myself, I can vouch for this. Coming in, I didn't know much at all about programming and site design, but I now feel like my technical knowledge in that field has greatly increased. I also now feel more comfortable in a working environment.
