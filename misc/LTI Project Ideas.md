# LTI Project ideas

Project ideas:

Make a site that tracks a user's progress on something toward a goal. An example of that would be recording a karate student's belt rank and skills learned.
Further explanation:
A checklist of knowledge/skills a user has acquired and ones to be learned. The user would be ranked on their current ability by the aforementioned belt system.

Make a site that updates over time, perhaps in relation to something else. Unlike the previous one, it would be less interactive and more informative. An example of that might be a counter that tracks something's number, or some kind of image rehosting.


Student project documentation:
Document the recent process of the collaboration of some students to create an app, the result of which benefitted all sides participating. The documentation may also have a checklist for students to mark what they have and haven't done.

Student project documentation confirmed as project.

Project ideas with Luke have been omitted due to the current impossibility of his participation.
